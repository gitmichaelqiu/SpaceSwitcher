**SpaceSwitcher** is a macOS workspace enhancer that lets you control **which app to show** in each workspace. Especially for apps that you have **assigned to all desktops**.

## 📦 Installation

Requires **macOS 13.0 Ventura** or above.

1. If you haven't, install [DesktopRenamer](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/releases/), which provides necessary SpaceAPI to inform SpaceSwitcher the current space info
2. Start SpaceAPI in DesktopRenamer Settings → General
3. Download the SpaceSwitcher from [Releases](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/SpaceSwitcher/releases/)
4. Drag the app to the *Applications* folder
5. All set!

Because I do **NOT** have an Apple developer account for the app releases ~~(Apple charges an annual fee for this)~~, you may receive alerts such as "App is broken".

To resolve this, go to System Settings → the bottom of Privacy & Security → Open DesktopRenamer.

## 🛜 SpaceAPI

To get the current space's information, an extra app DesktopRenamer is required. You can download it [here](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/releases/).

After downloading DesktopRenamer, you need to turn on SpaceAPI in Settings → General.

## 💡 Tips

The app will not work as expected when you connect to **multiple** displays, for an issue in DesktopRenamer. I am currently working on solving this. If you have any ideas, you are welcomed to post them in [DesktopRenamer Issues](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/issues).
